# Pattern 8: Overlapping Intervals

## 🌍 Real World Case
Imagine you are an **office manager** who needs to book **meeting rooms**. There are many meeting requests at different times: Meeting A (9-10), Meeting B (9:30-11), Meeting C (11-12). You need to know: how many rooms are needed minimum? Which meetings overlap and need to be merged? This pattern solves these problems!

Another example: **Calendar app** that merges adjacent appointments, or **server load balancer** that combines time ranges with high traffic.

## 📊 Concept Visualization

Problem: Merge overlapping intervals

Input: [[1,3], [2,6], [8,10], [15,18]]

Timeline visualization:
0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18
    [-------]
        [---------------]
                                [-------]
                                                                [----------]

Step 1: Sort by start time (already sorted)
[[1,3], [2,6], [8,10], [15,18]]

Step 2: Merge overlapping intervals

Check [1,3] and [2,6]:
    [-------]
        [---------------]
    ↓
    [-------------------]  ← Merged to [1,6]

Check [1,6] and [8,10]:
    [-------------------]
                                [-------]
    No overlap! Keep both.

Check [8,10] and [15,18]:
                                [-------]
                                                                [----------]
    No overlap! Keep both.

Result: [[1,6], [8,10], [15,18]]

Timeline after merge:
0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18
    [-------------------]
                                [-------]
                                                                [----------]

Overlap Detection Rule:
Two intervals [a,b] and [c,d] overlap if: b >= c
(end of first >= start of second)
```

## 💻 Python Code with Visualization

```python
from typing import List

def merge_intervals(intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Merge all overlapping intervals
    
    Process visualization:
    intervals = [[1,3], [2,6], [8,10], [15,18]]
    
    Step 1: Sort by start time
    [[1,3], [2,6], [8,10], [15,18]] (already sorted)
    
    Step 2: Initialize with first interval
    merged = [[1,3]]
    
    Step 3: Process [2,6]
    Last interval: [1,3]
    Current: [2,6]
    3 >= 2? YES → Overlap!
    Merge: [1, max(3,6)] = [1,6]
    merged = [[1,6]]
    
    Step 4: Process [8,10]
    Last interval: [1,6]
    Current: [8,10]
    6 >= 8? NO → No overlap
    Add [8,10]
    merged = [[1,6], [8,10]]
    
    Step 5: Process [15,18]
    Last interval: [8,10]
    Current: [15,18]
    10 >= 15? NO → No overlap
    Add [15,18]
    merged = [[1,6], [8,10], [15,18]]
    
    Key Pattern:
    1. Sort by start time
    2. Check if current overlaps with last merged
    3. If yes: extend last merged's end time
    4. If no: add current as new interval

Merge process step-by-step:

Step 1: Initialize with first interval
  merged = [[1, 3]]

Step 2: Process [2, 6]
  Last interval: [1, 3]
  Current: [2, 6]
  3 >= 2 → OVERLAP!
  Merge: [1, 3] + [2, 6] = [1, 6]
  merged = [[1, 6]]

Step 3: Process [8, 10]
  Last interval: [1, 6]
  Current: [8, 10]
  6 < 8 → No overlap
  Add new interval: [8, 10]
  merged = [[1, 6], [8, 10]]

Step 4: Process [15, 18]
  Last interval: [8, 10]
  Current: [15, 18]
  10 < 15 → No overlap
  Add new interval: [15, 18]
  merged = [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

When to use?
✅ "Merge intervals"
✅ "Find conflicts/overlaps"
✅ "Minimum resources needed"
✅ Scheduling problems
```

## 🎯 When to Use This Pattern?

- ✅ Problems with **intervals/ranges** that overlap
- ✅ Keywords: "merge intervals", "overlapping", "conflicts", "scheduling"
- ✅ **Resource allocation** problems (meeting rooms, parking, etc)
- ✅ Time-based data that needs to be combined or analyzed

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

- **Time**: O(n log n) - Sorting dominates, merge is only O(n)
- **Space**: O(n) - Output array for result
- **Key step**: ALWAYS sort by start time first!
