# LeetCode Patterns: Implementations and Visualizations (EN / ID)

A curated, bilingual (English and Bahasa Indonesia) collection of solutions and visual explanations for the LeetCode patterns popularized by Algomaster’s article: https://blog.algomaster.io/p/15-leetcode-patterns

This repository gathers practical notes, step‑by‑step strategies, and hand‑drawn style visuals to help you recognize and apply each pattern quickly during interviews or practice.

Note: The original article covers 15 patterns. This repo currently documents a subset and will be updated over time.


## Patterns and Guides
Each pattern has two guides: EN (English) and ID (Bahasa Indonesia).

- Sliding Window — [EN](sliding-window/sliding_window_en.md) | [ID](sliding-window/sliding_window_id.md)
- Two Pointers — [EN](two-pointer/two_pointers_en.md) | [ID](two-pointer/two_pointers_id.md)
- Fast & Slow Pointers — [EN](fast-slow-pointers/fast_slow_pointers_en.md) | [ID](fast-slow-pointers/fast_slow_pointers_id.md)
- Modified Binary Search — [EN](modified-binary-search/modified_binary_search_en.md) | [ID](modified-binary-search/modified_binary_search_id.md)
- Linked List Reversal — [EN](linked-list-reversal/linkedlist_reversal_en.md) | [ID](linked-list-reversal/linkedlist_reversal_id.md)
- Monotonic Stack — [EN](monotonic-stack/monotonic_stack_en.md) | [ID](monotonic-stack/monotonic_stack_id.md)
- Top K Elements — [EN](top-k-elements/top_k_elements_en.md) | [ID](top-k-elements/top_k_elements_id.md)
- Prefix Sum — [EN](prefix-sum/prefix_sum_en.md) | [ID](prefix-sum/prefix_sum_id.md)
- Overlapping Intervals — [EN](overlapping-intervals/overlapping_intervals_en.md) | [ID](overlapping-intervals/overlapping_intervals_id.md)
- Dynamic Programming — [EN](dynamic-programming/dynamic_programming_en.md) | [ID](dynamic-programming/dynamic_programming_id.md)
- Backtracking — [EN](backtracking/backtracking_en.md) | [ID](backtracking/backtracking_id.md)
- Tree DFS — (In progress)
- Tree BFS — (In progress)
- Graph / Topological Sort — (In progress)
- Greedy — (In progress)
- Bit Manipulation — (In progress)


## How to Use
- Pick a pattern from the list above.
- Start with the English or Indonesian guide based on your preference.
- Each guide includes:
  - When to use the pattern and common problem signs
  - Strategy templates and tips
  - Worked examples and visual walkthroughs
  - Pitfalls and variations

If you’re actively practicing, try this flow:
1) Skim the guide (5–10 minutes) to internalize the template.
2) Attempt 1–2 problems using only the template hints.
3) Return to the guide to compare your approach with the visual steps.


## Visualizations
Many guides include small visual aids to reinforce the pattern’s core mechanics (pointer movements, window expansion/contracting, stack state changes, etc.). These are designed to be quick reminders rather than exhaustive diagrams.


## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! You can help by:
- Adding missing patterns from the Algomaster list
- Improving explanations or visuals
- Fixing typos (EN / ID) and polishing translations

Please open an issue or pull request with a short description of the change. For new guides, follow the existing folder structure and provide both EN and ID versions when possible.
